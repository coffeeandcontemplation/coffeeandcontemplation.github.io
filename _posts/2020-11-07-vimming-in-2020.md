> If you use vim, you can use `h,j,k,l` keys to navigate instead of the arrow keys. You won't have to move your hands away from the home row, and you'll end up saving a lot of time.

One of my seniors in college told me this about vim. It sounded so incredibly ridiculous at that time, that I decided to give it a shot.

For the first couple of years, my `.vimrc` looked like this.
```vim
set nu
set cindent
syntax on
```
This enabled line numbers, indentation and added some syntax highligting to the code.

My real journey into vim started with this post titled ["How I boosted my vim"](https://nvie.com/posts/how-i-boosted-my-vim/) by Vincent Driessen.
It introduced me to vim's plugin ecosystem and I found out there is more to vim than `h,j,k,l`.

10 years later, my [(neo)vim](https://neovim.io/) looks like this:

## Basic setup
Depending on if you are using vim or neovim, startup file is different. For vim, it is `~/.vimrc`.
For neovim, it is `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`. Add the following block into your startup file.

```vim
filetype plugin indent on
syntax on

set modeline
set encoding=utf-8
set termencoding=utf-8
set tabstop=4                   " a tab is four spaces
set expandtab                   " Use spaces to insert a <TAB>
set backspace=indent,eol,start  " allow backspacing over everything
                                " in insert mode
set autoindent                  " always set autoindenting on
set copyindent                  " copy the previous indentation
                                " on autoindenting
set number                      " always show line numbers
set shiftwidth=4                " number of spaces to use
                                " for autoindenting
set shiftround                  " use multiple of shiftwidth when
                                " indenting with '<' and '>'
set smarttab                    " insert tabs on the start
                                " of a line according to
                                " shiftwidth, not tabstop
set hlsearch                    " highlight search terms
set incsearch                   " show search matches as you type
set ignorecase                  " ignore case when searching
set smartcase                   " ignore case if search pattern is all
                                " lowercase, case-sensitive otherwise
set scrolloff=8                 " Start scrolling at the last 8 lines
set history=1000                " remember more commands and search history
set undolevels=1000             " 1000 levels of undo
set title                       " change the terminal's title
set noerrorbells                " don't beep
set wildmenu                    " Better command line completion
set wildmode=list:longest,full
set nobackup                    " no backup files
set nowritebackup
set noswapfile                  " no swap files
set nolazyredraw
set hidden
set cmdheight=2                 " Better display for messages
set updatetime=300
set inccommand=nosplit          " Preview for search and replace
                                " (neovim only)

set pastetoggle=<F2> " F2 Toggles set paste
au InsertLeave * set nopaste " Exit paste mode when leaving insert mode

" No shift for :

If you would like to know more details about any of these settings, you can do a `:h <command>`. For eg:- `:h autoindent`

## Plugins
[`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) by Junegunn Choi is a good candidate for a plugin manager.

Install `vim-plug`.

**For vim in osx, linux**
```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```
**For neovim in osx, linux**
```
sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
```
For others, see [here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation). When you start vim next, the `vim-plug` will be installed.

Now, let us install a plugin called `lightline`.  The URL for `lightline` on github is [https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim). You need to use the url slug for the plugin to install it; like shown below.

```
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

Plug 'itchyny/lightline.vim'

call plug#end()
```
To install the plugin, quit vim and run `vim +PlugInstall`. When you restart vim, you can see a better status line(the line the bottom of vim).

`vim-plug` provides some [commands](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#commands) to manage plugins. Here are some I use often.
1. `PlugInstall` - Installs all the listed plugins in `vimrc`.
1. `PlugUpdate` - Updates all the listed plugins in `vimrc`.
1. `PlugClean` - Removes unlisted plugins.
