I woke up today and was welcomed by a mountain of dishes in the sink. My first reaction was - "Screw that - I'll just go back to bed". So, after a couple more hours of sleep, I went back to find that the mountain hadn't magically disappeared.

Now I had to tackle this problem. This is the strategy I followed

1. Move everything out of the sink back into the kitchen.
1. Take 5 utensils into the sink.
1. Wash them.
1. If there are more dishes left, goto 2.

That was it! The mountain of dishes were done.

This is how a typical Monday looks like too. You wake up - look at the mountin of tasks - try to do them all at once - fail miserably - wonder at the end of the week, what went wrong.

All you need to do is this - split the tasks into *"5-utensil-size"* tasks. Tackling smaller tasks is easy and far, far less intimidating.

I've started doing that now, and not digitally. Grabbed a notebook and started adding tasks in there and splitting them. The inspiration for this came from the [Bullet journal method](https://bulletjournal.com/) designed by Ryder Carroll.
